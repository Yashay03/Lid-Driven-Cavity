Hi this is the original code and report for the assignment i did for my CFD class as a undergraduate, there might be some hint of AI being used but it is still a working and original code for Steady lid driven cavity that works for 3 schemes - CDS, Upwind and Hybrid. The code is written in Python language. If you're using vs code i dont think you need any more libraries/packages to run this.
