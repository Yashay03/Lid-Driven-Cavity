Prompted v0.dev to add unsteady term to my steady code and voila you have this code, I am not sure of its accuracy but the contours and plots look good so i am just going to leave it here!
Please try to verify the coefficients when you do discretization

UPWIND and QUICK gives might give some trouble, use CDS
